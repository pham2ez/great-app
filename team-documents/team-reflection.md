# Team Reflection

We managed to build a mostly working product. Given our level of knowledge prior to starting the class and the amount of time that we had to complete it, we’re proud of what we accomplished.

The work was not split very well between teammates. In the early stages of the project, the tasks which were assigned to certain people were harder than those assigned to others. Subsequently, other members of the team would let that person deal with any further work or bug fixes, and as a result, near the end of the project, the workloads were very unbalanced. This issue might have been avoided had everyone endeavored to explain their own work and to understand the entirety of the project; then, all members of the team would have the knowledge to complete any task. In the future, we could have each team members test another member’s part of the project to increase overall understanding of different components of the project, and also avoid last minute pushes to finish implementation, which prevented us from doing adequate testing.

However, we communicated fairly effectively in order to claim parts of write-ups, triage bugs, and remind everyone about deadlines. Additionally, relationships between teammates were honest but cordial. We also did a good job of meeting regularly and having team discussions about design decisions, which kept us on the same page in terms of how our app should behave.

I am ever grateful to my teammates for their design and technical expertise, their superior organization skills, and their seemingly endless patience and kindness. I would also like to sincerely thank the 6.170 staff for their time and effort. Taking this class has taught me new skills, broadened my horizons, and helped me explore my career options. It also allowed me to experience what it is to be one of the less competent and less passionate members of a team. Because of this experience, I realized that I need to make an active effort to keep up with hardworking teammates rather than letting them tackle the majority of the project.

### April

To Jenna’s earlier point, I would like to contend and say that everyone made equally-valuable contributions to the project, and I’m grateful to have worked with everyone on my team. I did, however, feel that roles may have been a little unbalanced, as I found myself unwittingly becoming the PM of this project, although I was eventually ok with doing so. I learned the importance of making adjustments early on, as well as perhaps prioritizing functionality over ambitious designs. I think we initially tried to implement too many features, which spread our team thin and didn’t allow us to fully test and flesh out each concept. In addition, team organization definitely helped keep us on track at the end; I found that keeping a checklist of things to implement or bugs we noticed and assigning people to specific items helped keep us on the same page, especially when we didn’t have time to all meet in person. I wish this was a strategy we used early on, rather than only toward the end of the project.
    
### Tuyet

I do agree with April that we might have been spreading ourselves thin by adding so many features that we did not focus on getting the main features of our app performing to their maximum capacity; therefore, it got very difficult in the end because we were often uncertain about whether or not something would break.

However, working on this project really helped me to understand reactive programming and backend programming better, really widening the realm of things that is possible for me to create for the future. The project was challenging but also a lot of fun to work on. To a certain extent, I was able to work with everyone else’s code and if I had any questions, my teammates were very responsive and were willing to help. For next time, an even better way of communication would be to use slack and instead have multiple channels with specific categories about engineering, documents, etc. because sometimes a message someone would have would go unseen and forgotten about because it got lost in Messenger.

I am very glad to have taken this class and worked on this project with my team, particularly as someone with more of a design background than a software background. I learned a lot and feel that I can continue to apply the things I've learned on this project in the future if I choose.

Working with a team of four to implement a more complicated project was valuable, but also very difficult in the context of other classes we're all taking as active MIT students. I think my teammates have summarized well the bumps we encountered due to communication issues and workload balancing. I've been fortunate this semester to be a part of two major group projects, one in 6.170 and one in Course 4. I'm starting a full time job next semester and have greatly appreciated all of the work experience and interpersonal skills I've been developing.
