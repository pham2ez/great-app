# Meeting Notes

## Summary of Discussions
* We went over our hit/missed milestones, as well as challenges faced
* We can modify project plan if changes are made (graded based on how many points we hit in the plan)
* Potential idea: setting approvals on a scale (happy/neutral/sad face)

## Some Advice
* Possibly reduce the availability view so you can only see your own or the groupâ€™s at a time
* For notifying users, think about how often things will change
    * Just use in-browser notifications for the purpose of this class
* For revised design, can use full design doc but highlight changes

## Decisions/Changes Moving Forward
* We will modify approvals to reflect a wider degree of willingness/enthusiasm to eat at restaurants
* Added restaurant sorting and time finalization to next milestone, but otherwise no changes to our plan/milestones
