# ChAJA Team Contract
Members: aprilxie, animrick, himawan, pham2ez

## Expected level of achievement & effort for each team member
* Complete assigned individual milestone for each week, including both code implementation and testing
* Update members on progress or setbacks
* Include documentation for important functions and comment code appropriately
* Also document design decisions (log your thoughts/thought process)

## Personal goals for each team member
* Jenna: make a project which seems like it could be genuinely useful and societally beneficial; hopefully we can make it pretty, but I want it to be usable
* Tuyet: want to work on both front and back end and make a useful app that doesn’t yet exist/could be improved upon
* April: create a functional application that people would genuinely use, learn how to use a new external API, and also incorporate feedback from real users to improve features or the UI
* Alicia: work with a team on a project that requires significant collaboration, get practice with design outside the scope of architecture. 

## Frequency, length and location of team meetings
* https://www.when2meet.com/?8355748-i1Stq 
* **Sundays 12:30-3PM (EECS Student Lounge)**
* **Thursdays 5:30-7:30PM (Simmons 4AB)**
* These may be adjusted, and additional meetings may be scheduled, if needed

## How quality of work will be maintained
* Each person completes their individual part a day or two before the class deadline, and then dedicate the remaining time for the group to quality check and integrate all the parts
* Make sure to test that a component works before pushing it to GitHub
* Notify members when you’re about to push and ask if they have concerns
* Notify members that a buggy component is being pushed if necessary

## How tasks will be assigned, and what to do if deadlines are missed
* [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_jxZ-hchBJskJ2PBZ_lQFnwK5tNFkvB5KyN2S6_zvXU/edit#gid=0): we write out which tasks need to get done and when they need to be done by; people can claim tasks that are interesting to them on a FCFS basis; each person can also log the hours that they spent working on a particular task, and we can use formulas to balance out hours between team members
* What to do about missed deadlines: it happens! We are all busy, and sometimes there just isn’t enough time to get things done. Everyone should feel free to ask for help when they need it, and simply work to finish their tasks as soon as possible.

## How decisions will be made and disagreements resolved
* Decisions will be made unanimously, unless:
  * We have been discussing the same topic for more than 30 min, in which case the majority wins
  * If there is no majority after 1 hr, coin flip
